# ipp-sys - Bindings to Intel Integrated Performance Primitives (Intel IPP).

This directory contains several crates:

 - `ipp-sys`: toplevel convenience crate that depends on `ipp-headers-sys` and `link-*` crates
 - `ipp-headers-sys`: provide FFI headers from `ipp.h` (made with `bindgen`)
 - `ipp-sys-build-help`: helper for build.rs in the `link-*` crates
 - `link-ippcore`: link ippcore library
 - `link-ippvm`: link ippvm library
 - `link-ippcv`: link ippcv library
 - `link-ippdc`: link ippdc library
 - `link-ippcp`: link ippcp library
 - `link-ippi`: link ippi library
 - `link-ipps`: link ipps library

Typically, you can just depend on `ipp-sys`. The `link-*` crates do not provide
any rust code, but only serve to link the relevant IPP library. There are
multiple `link-*` crates because [the Cargo manifest `links` field supports only
linking only a single library per
crate](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/manifest.html#the-links-field-optional).

Link dependencies are done according to the [intel-integrated-performance-primitives-intel-ipp-library-dependencies-by-domain](https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/intel-integrated-performance-primitives-intel-ipp-library-dependencies-by-domain)
